# SimpliFi



## Inspiration
As our world shifts to mobile payments, it's becoming harder and harder to budget our finances and differentiate between luxuries and necessities.

## What It Does
A simple financial wellness application that allows you to scan receipts and track
transactions in a minimal list to visualize spending and create
budgets.

## How we built it
* React and Material-UI frameworks for development of authentication, transactions, and budget user interfaces
* Firebase API for user authentication and cloud integration
* Google Cloud Vision OCR for conversion of image text into machine-encoded text
* Google Cloud NLP Content Classifier for classification of receipt items into a taxonomy of unique shopping categories

## Challenges we faced
* Transfer of variables through javascript
* Implementation of the OCR to register the correct information
* Content categorization
* Synchronizing API calls

## Accomplishments we're proud of
* A simple and friendly user interface
* Perfect carry-out and usage of multiple API's
* Application of machine learning to assign receipt items an appropriate category

## What we learned
We learned a lot of technical skills such as api implementation, web server hosting, and front-end vs. back-end design.

## What's next for SimpliFI
We believe SimpliFI has much more potential for additional features.


Location and Fraud

* Keep a record of where all purchases were made
* Purchase made in another country will alert user of possible fraud


User Spending Habits

* Use machine learning to determine the best budgeting plan based on the user's spending habits
